## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If you see network errors:**

```
❌ Error uploading students CSV: Network Error
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
```

**Solution:** The ngrok URL is working, so this shouldn't happen. Check browser console for more details.

### **If you see CORS errors:**

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution:** Backend CORS is configured correctly based on our tests.

### **If you see authentication errors:**

```
{"success":false,"message":"Access token required"}
```

**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in with valid admin credentials.
